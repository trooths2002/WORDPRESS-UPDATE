I'll fix the logo display issue first, then help you update your live WordPress site through the admin dashboard.

‚úÖ Logo Fixed - Added fallback handling so RT initials will show if the logo doesn't load.

Now for updating your live WordPress site using only admin dashboard access:
üéØ WordPress Admin Dashboard Update Plan

Since you only have admin access (no server/FTP), we'll work within WordPress limitations:
üìã What I Need From You:

    WordPress Admin Login Details:
        Your website URL (therighteousteachers.org/wp-admin)
        Admin username
        Admin password

    Current WordPress Info:
        What theme are you currently using?
        What page builder (if any) - Elementor, Gutenberg, etc.?
        Do you have any backup/export plugins installed?

üîß Update Strategy (Admin Dashboard Only):

Phase 1: Theme & Design (CSS)

    Upload cosmic theme CSS through Appearance ‚Üí Customize ‚Üí Additional CSS
    Add custom colors, fonts, and galaxy background styles
    Update site logo through Appearance ‚Üí Customize ‚Üí Site Identity

Phase 2: Content Updates

    Replace current content with real historical content
    Upload your media files through Media Library
    Create new pages/posts with cosmic styling

Phase 3: Audio & PDF Integration

    Use Audio Player plugins for the 1958 recordings
    Document management plugins for PDF research papers
    Set up download controls for members

üé® Cosmic Theme Implementation Options:

Option A: Custom CSS (Easiest)

    I'll provide all cosmic theme CSS code
    You paste it in Appearance ‚Üí Additional CSS
    Works with any theme

Option B: Child Theme (Better)

    Upload child theme files via Appearance ‚Üí Themes
    More control over design

Option C: Page Builder (If you have Elementor)

    Custom cosmic sections
    Full design control

üìÇ File Upload Strategy:

Since you can't access server files directly:

    Media Library: Upload all images, logos, audio files
    Plugin Install: Audio players, PDF viewers
    Custom CSS: All cosmic styling code

üîê What Access I'd Need:

To help you directly, I could:

    Screen share while you're in WordPress admin
    Step-by-step instructions for each change
    Provide all code/files for you to copy-paste

Would you prefer:

    Screen share session where I guide you through the changes?
    Detailed written instructions with all the code?
    Video walkthrough of the entire process?

Please provide:

    Your WordPress admin URL
    Current theme name
    Which approach you prefer

I'll then create a complete cosmic theme package that works within WordPress admin limitations!
